zentwm
======

A wayland tiling window manager based on the swc library written in C++

It is still in heavy development, so please report bugs if you find any! :)

#### Installation

The requirements is the latest git version of [swc](https://github.com/michaelforney/swc).
After that, simply make the project.
There's currently no make install in the Makefile however.

#### Usage

Simply run "swc-launch $PATH_TO_ZENTWM"


#### General ToDo

- Decide whether to use camelcase or _
- Add support for hooks at specific events

#### Wont Fix
- Multiscreen (until either nvidia starts supporting wayland or i buy an amd card)
